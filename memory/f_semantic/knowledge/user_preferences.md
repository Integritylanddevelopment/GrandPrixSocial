# User Preferences - Grand Prix Social

## Critical Design Requirements

### NO EMOJIS POLICY
**ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS ANYWHERE**
- User despises emojis and considers them cheap, ugly, and unprofessional
- Never use emojis in:
  - Email templates
  - Website content  
  - UI elements
  - Marketing materials
  - Any communication
  - Code comments or documentation

### Icon Guidelines
- Use Lucide icons or Radix icons instead of emojis
- Professional icon libraries only
- No phone-style emoji icons ever

### Design Philosophy
- Clean, professional aesthetics
- No childish or casual visual elements
- Focus on sophisticated, mature design choices

## Implementation Notes
- This preference has been applied to:
  - Email confirmation templates (updated to remove all emojis)
  - All future development must follow this rule
  - Check existing codebase for any emoji usage to remove

**REMEMBER: This is a hard requirement - never suggest or use emojis for this user under any circumstances.**
