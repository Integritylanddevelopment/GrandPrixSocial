MEMORY AGENT INTEGRATION EXAMPLES
=================================

Examples showing how memory agents use working memory utilities.
These are integration patterns, not standalone scripts.

This demonstrates the subordinate utility architecture:
- Memory agents call these utilities
- Utilities never run independently
- Full integration with TTL/archival/preservation patterns
