# ACTIVE SESSION - Grand Prix Social Development
*Started: 08-19_04-35PM*
*Builder: Stephen Alexander*
*Assistant: Claude*

## Session Context
- Project: Grand Prix Social (F1 fan platform)
- Status: **LIVE ON INTERNET** ✅
- Focus: Memory system activation & agent orchestration

## Key Decisions This Session
1. Memory persistence = PROMOTION not deletion after ~1 week
2. Keep Supabase for quick launch, own cloud later
3. Activate memory agents to start working NOW
4. Memory should be recording everything we discuss

## Technical Understanding
- Working Memory → Gets promoted to other memory types
- Tagging & vectorization for searchability
- Agents need to activate and start processing
- Dual database: Supabase (live) + Memory (context)

## Current Work
- Setting up memory agents to actively process
- Creating promotion pipelines
- Establishing tagging system
