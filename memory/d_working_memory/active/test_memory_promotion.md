# Test Memory Promotion
*Created: 2025-08-20 05:56PM*

## Purpose
This is a test file to verify that the memory agents are:
1. Detecting new files in working memory
2. Tagging content appropriately
3. Routing to correct memory types
4. Promoting aged content to long-term memory

## F1 Racing Context
This file contains F1 racing keywords to test semantic routing:
- Formula 1
- Grand Prix
- Racing
- Drivers
- Teams

## Authentication System
Also testing auth-related routing:
- Login
- Signup
- Supabase
- Authentication

## Development Notes
And development keywords:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- React
- Coding

## Expected Behavior
This file should be:
1. Tagged with f1_racing, user_auth, and development tags
2. Routed to semantic memory (F1 content)
3. Eventually promoted to long-term memory after aging threshold
