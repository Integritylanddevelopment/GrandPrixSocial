# CORE LOGIC REFACTOR - CHANGE LOG
**Date:** 06-19_02-15PM  
**Version:** 1.0 â†’ 2.0  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Authorized By:** Stephen Alexander (System Builder)

---

## SUMMARY

Comprehensive refactor and expansion of the CommandCore OS Core Logic document from a basic rules file to a complete system governance document. This update establishes authoritative control over all agents, memory types, AI tagging, timestamps, and operational protocols.

- Memory hierarchy with protection levels

### 3. AI Tagging System Requirements (New Section)
- Hybrid tagging architecture (structured + semantic + compound)
- Tag DNA system with semantic vectors and effectiveness tracking
- Tag learning and self-improvement requirements
- Integration with TagIntelligenceEngine

### 4. Standardized Timestamp Protocols
- Mandatory format: `%m-%d_%I-%M%p`
- Prohibition of legacy formats
- Enforcement and validation requirements

### 5. Agent Autonomy & Orchestration (New Section)

- Archival integrity maintenance

### 9. GUI & Interface Governance (Expanded)
- Read-only defaults and safety protocols
- User experience requirements
- Bulk operation safeguards

### 10. Protected Classifications (New Section)
- Protected tags and directories
- Access control levels
- Builder authorization requirements

### 11. Enforcement & Violation Protocols (New Section)
- Agent enforcement responsibilities
- Violation response procedures
- Audit requirements and schedules

### 12. Performance & Optimization (New Section)
- Caching strategies
- Resource management protocols
- Performance monitoring requirements

### 13. Integration & Extension Protocols (New Section)
- External system integration rules
- Extension development standards
- Testing and compliance requirements

### 14. Disaster Recovery & Continuity (New Section)
- Backup requirements and procedures
- Recovery protocols and validation
- Business continuity planning

### 15. Maintenance & Updates (New Section)
- Update authorization levels
- Change management procedures
- Version control and rollback protocols

---

## ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT

### Authority Level
- Upgraded from general guidance to **ABSOLUTE** authority
- System-wide enforcement across all components
- Builder signature and intellectual property protection

### Compliance Requirements
- All agents must validate against core logic
- Automatic violation detection and correction
- Comprehensive audit trails and reporting

### Protection Levels
- File protection against unauthorized modification
- Access control for system-critical components
- Backup requirements for protected file changes

---

## BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

### Preserved Elements
- Original memory retention policies maintained
- Core beliefs and builder intent preserved
- Protected tags and keywords maintained

### Enhanced Elements
- Expanded memory type definitions
- Detailed operational procedures
- Comprehensive enforcement protocols

### Deprecated Elements
- Legacy timestamp formats (automatic conversion required)
- Manual agent triggers (must be replaced with autonomous operation)
- Hardcoded credentials (must use environment variables)

---

## IMPLEMENTATION IMPACT

### Immediate Requirements
1. All agents must validate timestamp format compliance
2. AI tagging system integration for memory-touching agents
3. Autonomous operation validation for all scripts
4. Schema management protocol compliance

### Short-Term Alignment (Next 30 Days)
1. Agent refactoring to align with new standards
2. Legacy format conversion and cleanup
3. Enhanced logging and error handling implementation
4. Tag intelligence integration across all memory agents

### Long-Term Evolution (Next 90 Days)
1. Full system audit and compliance validation
2. Performance optimization and caching implementation
3. Disaster recovery testing and validation
4. Advanced AI tagging feature deployment
