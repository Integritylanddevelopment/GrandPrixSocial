# 🧠 Memory — CommandCore OS
Memory Core 2.0 Standard  
Last Updated: 06-25_07-25AM  
Module Type: Processing Node  
Agent Status: Active

## 🧠 Cognitive Role
This module behaves like the **neural processing center**, responsible for managing memory. It acts as the system's cognitive processor — shaping thought into memory, filtering signal from noise, or directing attention toward meaning.

*"Where memory becomes conscious thought."*

## 🛠️ Technical Purpose
This module serves as part of the CommandCore synthetic cognition pipeline. It interacts with memory types and agents, supporting tasks like memory processing. Designed for real-time execution.

**Category:** Medium  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Core Trigger:** File Watcher

## 📦 What It Does
• Manages memory operations
• Stores and retrieves memory data
• Coordinates with memory agents

## 🧬 File Structure

└── g_episodic/
```

## 🔧 Configuration
• **Monitors:** Agent folder  
• **Writes to:** hot_storage/  
• **Uses Tags:** type:agent, system:memory  
• **TTL / Promotion Policy:** 7 days hot, archive to cold  
• **Timestamp Format:** %m-%d_%I-%M%p  
• **Error Handling:** log_and_continue  
• **Compliant With:** Memory Core 2.0

## 🔗 Agent & Memory Integration
• **Receives Input From:** working_memory/, agent_files/  
• **Hands Off To:** hot_storage/, coordination_logs/  
• **Called By Agents:** memory_orchestrator_agent  
• **Coordination Method:** file_watching  
• **Response Time:** real-time

## ⚙️ Dependencies
• watchdog
• pathlib

## 🧪 How to Run
```bash
python memory.py
```

For testing or diagnostics:
```bash
python memory.py --test
```

## 📈 Logs & Performance
• **Log File:** agent_interactions.log  
• **State File:** memory_state.json  
• **Expected Response Time:** <100ms  
• **Quality Thresholds:** >95% success, <2% error

## 🧠 Preservation Compliance
This module follows the Memory Core 2.0 rule: **Nothing is ever deleted. All data is versioned or archived.**

• **Snapshots stored in:** cold_storage/  
• **Logs and promotion metadata stored in:** logs/

## 📜 Summary
This module provides memory coordination, supporting the CommandCore OS as part of its evolving synthetic memory ecosystem. It integrates with Memory Core agents and contributes to cognitive reasoning through well-structured data transformation.

*Designed for clarity. Built for cognition. Structured for permanence.*

## 📎 Cognitive Compliance
*Auto-maintained by `readme_agent.py` using CommandCore OS 2.0 Standard*  
*Compliant with Memory Core Architecture Guidelines*
